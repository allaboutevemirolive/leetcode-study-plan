```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn rotate(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, k: i32) {
        let n = nums.len() as i32;
        nums.rotate_right((k%n) as usize);
    }
}
```




This code is a method implementation for a struct called `Solution` in Rust. It defines a public function named `rotate` that takes two parameters: `nums`, which is a mutable reference to a vector of `i32` integers, and `k`, which is an `i32` representing the number of positions to rotate the vector.

Let's break down the code step by step:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn rotate(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, k: i32) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The code starts with the `impl` keyword, which is short for "implementation." It indicates that we're defining methods for the `Solution` struct. Next, we have `pub fn rotate`, which means we're defining a public function named `rotate` for instances of the `Solution` struct. The `nums` parameter is a mutable reference to a vector of `i32` integers, and `k` is an `i32`.

```rust
let n = nums.len() as i32;
```

This line calculates the length of the `nums` vector and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length is converted to `i32` to match the type of `k`.

```rust
nums.rotate_right((k % n) as usize);
```

This line rotates the `nums` vector to the right by `k` positions. The `%` operator calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `n` to ensure that the rotation stays within the vector's length. The result is cast to `usize` (unsigned integer) because `rotate_right` expects the number of positions as a `usize` value.

To use this code, you can create an instance of the `Solution` struct and call the `rotate` function, passing in the vector and the desired number of rotations. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut nums = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let k = 2;

    Solution::rotate(&mut nums, k);

    println!("{:?}", nums);
}
```

This example would output `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]` because the vector has been rotated to the right by 2 positions.
