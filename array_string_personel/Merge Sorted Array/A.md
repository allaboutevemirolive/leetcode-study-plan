The task is to merge two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into a single array in non-decreasing order. The merged array should be stored in `nums1`.

Here's a simpler explanation:

You have two lists of numbers, `nums1` and `nums2`. Both lists are already sorted in increasing order. You also have two additional numbers, `m` and `n`, which represent the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Your goal is to combine the numbers from both lists into a single list, while keeping the numbers in sorted order. The final result should be stored in `nums1`, but with enough space to accommodate all the elements.

To solve this, you need to start from the end of the lists and compare the numbers from both lists. Take the larger number and place it at the end of `nums1`. Keep doing this until you have compared all the numbers in both lists and merged them into `nums1`.

After merging, you will have a sorted list in `nums1` with all the numbers from both `nums1` and `nums2`.

Note that the length of `nums1` is `m + n`, where the first `m` elements are the numbers to be merged, and the last `n` elements are initially set to 0 and should be ignored. The length of `nums2` is `n`.

Make sure to consider the given constraints while solving the problem.
