```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_element(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, val: i32) -> i32 {
        nums.retain(|&x| x != val);
        nums.len() as i32
    }
}
```



This code is implementing a function named `remove_element` as a method of a struct named `Solution` in Rust. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

- The `remove_element` function takes two parameters: `nums`, a mutable reference to a vector of `i32` values, and `val`, an `i32` value.
- The function removes all occurrences of `val` from the vector `nums`.
- The `retain` method is called on the `nums` vector. It takes a closure as an argument, which determines whether an element should be kept or removed from the vector. In this case, the closure `|&x| x != val` is used. It compares each element `x` with `val` and returns `true` if they are not equal, which means the element should be retained. Elements that are equal to `val` are removed from the vector.
- After the `retain` method is called, the function returns the length of the modified `nums` vector as an `i32` value.

To use this code, you would need to create an instance of the `Solution` struct and call the `remove_element` method on it, passing the appropriate arguments. For example:

```rust
let mut nums = vec![3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2];
let val = 2;

let solution = Solution {};
let result = solution.remove_element(&mut nums, val);

println!("Modified vector: {:?}", nums);
println!("Length after removal: {}", result);
```

This code would output:

```
Modified vector: [3, 3, 1, 4]
Length after removal: 4
```

The `nums` vector is modified to remove all occurrences of `val` (2 in this case), and the length of the modified vector is printed.
